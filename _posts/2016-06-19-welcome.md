## That New Site Smell!

The redesign and relaunch of [MoreOnCode.com]({{ site.baseurl }}) is pretty 
much complete.

After 10 years at my previous web address, I sold my domain to the highest 
bidder and spent the money on an HTC Vive and some magic beans. The beans 
were delicious.

After I update all my web accounts to use the new domain's email address, 
I hope to post more and more content here. If I don't, then this will serve 
as the landing page for all my hobby and OSS projects.

This site is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), using one 
of my OSS projects, [Jaytch](http://jaytch.org/) - a bootstrap-based template
and helper for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). My work is based on that of
[Jekyll-Bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) by 
[@plusjade](https://github.com/plusjade/), but adds a metric crapton of new
widgets and snippets.
