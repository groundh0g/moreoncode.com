On August 21, 2015, [I tweeted](https://twitter.com/groundh0g/status/634589308335210497) to announce my intention to expose the writing process of my next game programming book to the world.

> Decision made. New #gamedev / #indiedev @MonoGameTeam book will be written in public view, hosted on @github pages.

It's a scary proposition for me, but exciting at the same time. I'm used to writing in a vacuum, dumping the resulting work into the wild at the end of the process. My current setup allows for official bug reports via [GitHub issues](https://github.com/groundh0g/codecamps-book/issues), or via Facebook comments at the bottom of each chapter.

### My Motivation

I teach [a game programming camp]({{ site.baseurl }}/camps/index.html) for teens and tweens in Banner Elk, NC, every year. It's their games that inspired each of the examples in this book. I've been using [my 2007 book on XNA game programming](http://amzn.to/1JuxvD8) to guide the class, but it is starting to show its age. (Heck, it was showing its age in 2008.)

It's time for a new book. And this time around, I want the process to be open and I want to solicit feedback from my audience early in the process. I wrote my first book for me (a hobbyist game developer), and it did well enough. I hope this new approach will yield even better results.

### Current Status

If you're the kind of person that likes statistics, here's the current status of the project. This list is automatically updated whenever I make an edit to the book's content.

{% assign path=page.path %}
{% include jaytch/books/list-chapters.liquid path=path %}

### Support the Project

If you like this idea and want to support me, the easiest way is to [follow me on twitter](https://twitter.com/groundh0g). It's fast. It's free.

If you're the kind of bloke (or sheila) that likes to buy things ... I'm hosting the content on GitHub Pages, using Jekyll, but I've built the site in such a way that the same markdown files that render in your web browser are in the format expected by [LeanPub.com](https://leanpub.com/monogamecodecamps). That's a link to the book, but I haven't published it yet. I want to get more of the content out of draft status. And by "more" I mean "some".

And if you're a big spender, I plan on printing the book as a perfect-bound paperback via lulu.com. I used them for [my humor book](http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html) in early 2015, and I was impressed with the quality and value of my initial order.

If you're short on cash, remember that [following me on twitter](https://twitter.com/groundh0g) is free! Also keep in mind that I intend this content to be available on the web (also free), updated with some level of regularity.
