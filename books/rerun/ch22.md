# Chapter Twenty-two: The Bombing

- Substation is bombed.
- Not sure who really did it … Cecelia, Lukman, or Aldrich? Certainly not rebels.
- Given recent attention MIGCO focuses on Archie (partly at Tom’s suggestion)
- Darnell thinks it’s a bad idea. 
  - Realizes that Archie is rebel (Duh), but …
  - he just got his foot into the door. 
  - Could lead to bigger fish.
  - Besides, we don’t have any concrete evidence linking Archie to bomb.
- Aldrich decides to proceed. Have Archie picked up.
  - Why? Did Tom sway decision? Does Aldrich know who planted the bomb and is looking to Archie as patsy?
