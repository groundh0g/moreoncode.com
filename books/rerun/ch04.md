# Chapter Four: The Reporter

Kara Moran was the consummate overachiever. She had talent and ambition, but circumstances had not yet placed her in the path of the opportunities for which she longed. 

Kara was an accomplished field reporter for a regional news show. Her audience loved her reporting style and her range of stories. Her ratings were well above average. 

Kara was somewhat of a local celebrity, but she had long-term aspirations to land a job as an anchor with one of the national broadcast networks. She realized that it was a competitive field, but Kara was certain that she had the skills and desire to someday achieve her goals.

Today, she found herself outside a home that just been raided by the local authorities. A neighbor of the residence was a fan of Kara's work and immediately thought to call her station when they witnessed the marked vehicles of the raiding party assembling just up the street.

By the time Kara and her cameraman arrived, the raid was over. The officers that remained were collecting evidence and securing the residence. She had noticed several official vehicles leaving the scene as her news van pulled up. The action may have passed, but the story was still fresh.

The residence had been cordoned off, with a single officer standing guard to the activity behind him. Uniformed officers and crime scene technicians were in and out of the home carrying laptops, computers, external drives, and other high-tech gadgets to a waiting van.

Kara approached the officer at the property's edge to see what kind of information she could garner. She knew that rookies were typically assigned the more menial tasks. She hoped her charisma and his inexperience would combine so as to make her inquiries more fruitful.

As she neared the yellow and black caution tape, the officer asked her to step back. She motioned for her cameraman to stop recording and return to the van. In one smooth action, she dropped her raised microphone to her waist and slowed her approach.

"Hi. I'm Kara Moran, a reporter for WAKB. And you are?"

"I'm Steve. And I need to ask you to return to your van, ma'am."

"Steve, we received a tip that the authorities were executing a raid on a terrorist cell." Kara was bluffing. She didn't know a thing about the raid. At least she didn't until she saw Steve's reaction to her statement. It was a subtle tell, but it was enough to let Kara know that she was on the right track.

"I don't know anything about that, ma'am. Please return to your van," replied the young officer.

"Sure thing, Steve. I'm sorry to have bothered you," Kara responded as she turned around and made her way back to the van.

Kara said to the cameraman, "Let's get some shots of the loot that they're removing, Carl. I think there's a story here. I'm going to phone the office to see what they can dig up."

Before she had completed her instructions to Carl, she had her phone to her ear, listening for an answer. A few rings later, she heard the familiar voice of her research assistant.

"Sarah, this is Kara. I'm at the residence now. I think this was a raid on a terror cell. Would you see what you can dig up?"

"It's funny you should ask," said Sarah. "We just got a tip from one of our more reliable sources that it WAS a raid on a terror cell. How in the world did you know that?"

"Reporter's intuition," replied Kara. "Thanks for the confirmation. As you get more information, please forward it to my cell. I'm going to work with Carl to get a story ready based on our assumptions, but I don't want to broadcast anything that hasn't been well vetted." 

"Keep up the great work, Sarah. I'll be looking for that firm confirmation ASAP, OK?"

Kara started work on a script for the story while Carl gathered more footage of the activity around the residence. She wanted to have the activity as a backdrop for her report, but that meant working quickly. She had no idea when the officers on scene would wrap things up.

Kara's muse was clearly by her side today. Her fingers flew atop her laptop keyboard, pausing only occasionally to glance at her phone to read the updates on the raid that Sarah sent via text messages.

Twenty minutes later, Kara's script was ready. As luck would have it, there seemed to be more activity in front of the house than when she and Carl had first arrived. Even more amazing, no other reporters had arrived to the site yet. She waved Carl over.

"Are we set to do a take?" asked Kara as she stepped into position so that the house, caution tape, evidence van, and bustle would be clearly in frame.

"Absolutely. Just one second." Carl readied himself and his equipment to shoot the story.

Carl started the countdown. "In five, four, ..." the first two numbers were said aloud, but the final three came as hand signals followed by Carl pointing to Kara as her cue to start.

>In the first half of the twenty-first century, society shifted from an economic model that rewards a corrupt few to one that is no longer encumbered by the scarcity of resources or the inequity of income. In this remarkably utopian environment, poverty and classism have been abolished. 

>The oppression brought about by religion and arbitrary borders has been made obsolete. Long since established as basic human rights, no one is denied the necessities of food, shelter, health, or dignity.

>Unfortunately, there are a few contemptuous souls who seek only to dismantle the peace and tranquility that this brave new world affords its citizens. These traitorous rebels won't rest until the progress of the past decades is undone.

>Just three short years have passed since the insurrection began. In the beginning, the malcontented assemblage learned the folly of standing up to the superior might of a well-trained defensive force. The rebellion was quickly quelled, but remnants remain to wreak havoc in new ways.

>The rebels now cower in the shadows, launching an endless barrage of cyber-terrorism attacks against the infrastructure that supports our society and the patriots who defend its citizenry.

>Today, the patriots have scored a decisive victory. The scene you see behind me is that of a rebel cell being disrupted and dismantled. These rebels and their tools will no longer be instruments of terror. 

>The name of the owner of the residence is being withheld at this time. It appears that the property was leased to a small group of students who attend school at one of the local universities.

>This neighborhood is like any other. We never think it could be our neighborhood, our neighbors, who are aiding or actively participating in the rebellion. This scene serves as a stark reminder that we, the common citizens, must remain ever vigilant.

>Details on the raid are forthcoming. Stay tuned to this station for breaking news on this incident as it becomes available.

>For WAKB, this is Kara Moran.

"And ... cut. What did you think, Carl? Do we need another take?" asked Kara.

"Nope," he replied, "That was perfect. Let's get back to the station so we can edit in some of my earlier shots."
