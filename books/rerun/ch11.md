# Chapter Eleven: The Rendezvous

- Darnell uses identified social media hub to post a test msg.o	Won’t source be known? Nope. Use the same anonymizing network the rebels use.o	Biggest risk is that we don’t fully understand their encoding and we’re discovered as tampering with their comm channels. They may change their comm.
- Test message is for rendezvous.
- Another sting at Mad Canopy. Another bust.
- While waiting, Darnell analyzes more messages, sees pattern.
- Darnell determines how to tell which messages are not decoys.
- [More crap here.]
