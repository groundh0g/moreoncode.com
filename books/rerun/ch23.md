# Chapter Twenty-three: The Arrest

- Open with Dot unlocking the café. Maybe a couple of baristas are there waiting on her?
- From earlier notes “In later chapter: Harold gets evidence to authorities RE: the empty residential property that was raided. Maybe it’s Tom that handles the dirty work?”o	Maybe they pin the bombing on Archie?
- Police come to visit again.
- Archie is feeling less bold, less invincible.
- Archie puts his rebel phone into Dot’s purse when he suspects that he’ll be taken away.
- “Dot, will you mind the shop while I’m gone?”
