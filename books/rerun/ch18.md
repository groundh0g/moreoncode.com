# Chapter Eighteen: The Suspicions

- Darnell returns home after a long day of attempting to infiltrate the rebels.
- Prue notices that he’s not wearing his wedding band. WTH?
- It’s in the car. My finger was hurting earlier. I wanted to see if the ring was irritating my finger. Feels better now. I may have gained a little weight. Could be time to get it sized a little larger.
- Prue seems to buy the explanation… for now.
- [More stuff here.]
- [Potential storyline?: One of Prue’s friends mentions seeing Darnell the other day. He was with some girl. Prue recalls that as the day he didn’t have his wedding band on.]
