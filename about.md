## Who the Heck is Joe?

<hr/>

<div style="float:left; margin-bottom:15px;"><img alt="" src="images/super-joe.png" /></div>

Joseph Hall has been a professional software developer for more than 25 years. He worked as a programmer for Microsoft and IBM, he was the software architect for a Fortune 500 bank, he was the CTO of an online ticket sales and servicing company, and he started his own consulting company (Codetopia, LLC) in 2006.

Joe makes his living writing desktop, web, and mobile device applications for businesses and governmental agencies, but game programming is his passion, and it was gaming that got him into programming in the first place. He was a member of the original Xbox team and he joined the Visual Studio .NET team just after the Xbox was released in 2001.

He is the author of *<a href="http://amzn.to/1JuxvD8" target="_blank">XNA Game Studio Express: Developing Games for Windows and the Xbox 360</a>*, which was published in 2007, and *Fauxcabulary: Fake Definitions, Real Funny*, which was self-published in 2015 (for <a href="https://leanpub.com/fauxcabulary" target="_blank">eBook</a> and <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/http://www.lulu.com/shop/joseph-hall/fauxcabulary/paperback/product-22179468.html" target="_blank">print</a>). He has several new books in the pipeline including a multi-volume series on MonoGame development using Xamarin Studio and a techno-thriller trilogy set in the not-so-distant future.

Joe lives with his wife and three daughters in Montgomery, Alabama. Every summer, Joe teaches high school students how to write games during an intense weeklong course in North Carolina for Landry Academy. In his free time, Joe dabbles in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see his artistic creations, you'll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.

## What's MoreOnCode?

I have a lot of varied hobbies ... **a lot** of them. It's hard to tie such a motley collection together, so I picked a tongue-in-cheek name for a website and posted a bunch of [links to my other sites]({{ HOME_PATH }}).

The truth is that it's hard to keep everything in isolation, so I'll likely wind up [blogging more here]({{ BASE_PATH }}/blog.html) than at the sources. Not my brightest idea, but convenient.

In early 2015, I started a new adventure -- working as a software developer for <a href="http://www.thoughtworks.com" target="_blank">ThoughtWorks, Inc</a>, in Atlanta, GA. In my new role, I'm immersed in agile, extreme programming, and test-driven development methodologies. This old dog is learning new tricks!

In all likelihood, I'll blog about those experiences here as well.
